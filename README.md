# Operating System Basics

## What is an Operating System (OS)?
An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user. It provides a user-friendly interface and manages hardware resources to ensure efficient operation of the computer. Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

### Why Do We Need an OS?
- **Resource Management**: Manages CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
- **User Interface**: Provides a graphical or command-line interface for users.
- **Application Support**: Acts as a platform for running application software.
- **Security**: Ensures data protection and access control.
- **Multitasking**: Allows multiple applications to run simultaneously.

## What is a Kernel?
- The kernel is the core component of an operating system.
- It directly interacts with the hardware and provides low-level services to the system. The kernel is responsible for:
- **Process Management**: Scheduling and managing processes.
- **Memory Management**: Allocating and deallocating memory.
- **Device Drivers**: Facilitating communication between hardware and software.
- **System Calls**: Providing an interface for user applications to request services from the OS.

### Types of Kernels
- **Monolithic Kernel**: All OS services run in a single kernel space (e.g., Linux).
- **Microkernel**: Minimal kernel functionality, with most services running in user space (e.g., Minix).
- **Hybrid Kernel**: Combines features of monolithic and microkernels (e.g., Windows NT).

## What is Linux?
Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on the Unix architecture. It is widely used for servers, desktops, and embedded systems. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility.

### Key Features of Linux
- **Open Source**: Source code is freely available and can be modified.
- **Multiuser**: Supports multiple users simultaneously.
- **Multitasking**: Can run multiple processes at the same time.
- **Portability**: Can run on various hardware platforms.
- **Security**: Built-in security features like user permissions and firewalls.

## What are Linux Distributions?
A Linux distribution (or distro) is a packaged version of the Linux operating system that includes the Linux kernel, system utilities, and often additional software. 

- The kernel is the core.
- Linux Kernel + Apps = Distribution
- Linux concepts are universal.
- Each distro is slightly different.You can accomplish the same goals on most Linux distros.
- 
__you can find all distributions in https://distrowatch.com/ website__

__Examples:__

**Open Source:** OpenSuSE Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS

**Enterprise:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL),  SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)

**RHEL free distro:** AlmaLinux / Rocky Linux
    


## Summary
- Operating systems are essential for managing hardware and providing a platform for applications. 
- The kernel is the heart of the OS, and Linux is a powerful, open-source operating system with numerous distributions tailored for various needs.
